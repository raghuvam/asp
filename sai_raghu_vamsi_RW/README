COMPILING & RUNNING PROGRAM
###########################

1. Extract the source files and Change directory to the extracted folder. Then execute make as follow.
   
   $ make all
   
   It will generate two executables "writer" and "reducer". 
   And a shared libarary is generated in "<path_to_current_directory>/libs/"

2. Setup environment variable, this will allow the shared library to load at run time.
    
    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/libs:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

    (or)

    $ . ./set_env.sh

    If you are using the script make sure that you use "."(dot) before ./set_env.sh. This "." 
    allows the script to update the env variable in the current terminal only.
        
3. Run the writer program.
    
    $ ./writer

    You can write a message using write option.

4. Run reader program in seperate terminal. Again set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to "<path_to_current_directory>/libs/".

    $ ./reader

    You can read a message using read option.
