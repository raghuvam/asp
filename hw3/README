#
## NOTATION ##
#
The following example of 4 philosophers (4 forks) shows the 
naming convention followed in the program.
    
    4 Phliosophers ids = {0,1,2,3}
    4 Forks ids        = {0,1,2,3}

            [Ph_2] 

        f=2         f=1

  [Ph_3]                [Ph_1]
         
        f=3         f=0
            
            [Ph_0] 

#
## Steps for compiling the code: ##
#
1. Run make to build the executable from source code.
        
    $ make all
        
   A executable "dining_philosopher" is generated in the current 
   working directory.
#
## Running the program ##
#
2. The program takes two arguments. First argument define no. of 
   philosopher [N] process to be created. Second argument defines 
   no. of times [M] the philosophers loop must iterate.

    $ ./dining_philosophers  <N>  <M>
    
  Eg:
    $ ./dining_philosophers  5  2
