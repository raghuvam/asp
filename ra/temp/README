###### COMPILING & RUNNING THE PROGRAM #######
##############################################

Mapper reads the strings from each line of the input text file and prints
the (word,1) pair to the stdout. Reducer reads the strings from stdin and
formats the string to extract the word, stores the counts fo no.of times 
the word is encountered as (key,value) pair in the linked list. If the Reducer
reads a word with a new starting charcter than previous one, is prints the
(key, value) pairs of the previous words.

Combines starts as a Parent process and creates a pipe. IT then creates the 
Reducer as first child, which keeps listening on the read end of the pipe.
Then a new child 2 is created, which executes the Mapper program, which pumps
data to the write end of the pipe. Reduces then receives the words the prints
the count as expected.


1. Compile the program usign make, this build mapper, reducer and 
   combiner executables.

	$ make all
	
2. To run the program, the input text file must be given
	as argument to the combiner program.

	$ ./combiner <input_file_name>

3. To remove all the executables, if necessary.
	
	$ make clean
